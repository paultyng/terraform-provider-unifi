# unifi_port_profile (Resource)

`unifi_port_profile` manages a port profile for use on network switches.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "vlan_id" {
  default = 10
}

resource "unifi_network" "vlan" {
  name    = "wifi-vlan"
  purpose = "corporate"

  subnet       = "10.0.0.1/24"
  vlan_id      = var.vlan_id
  dhcp_start   = "10.0.0.6"
  dhcp_stop    = "10.0.0.254"
  dhcp_enabled = true
}

resource "unifi_port_profile" "poe_disabled" {
  name = "POE Disabled"

  native_networkconf_id = unifi_network.vlan.id
  poe_mode              = "off"
}
```
