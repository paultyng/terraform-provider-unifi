# unifi_network (Resource)

`unifi_network` manages WAN/LAN/VLAN networks.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "vlan_id" {
  default = 10
}

resource "unifi_network" "vlan" {
  name    = "wifi-vlan"
  purpose = "corporate"

  subnet       = "10.0.0.1/24"
  vlan_id      = var.vlan_id
  dhcp_start   = "10.0.0.6"
  dhcp_stop    = "10.0.0.254"
  dhcp_enabled = true
}

resource "unifi_network" "wan" {
  name    = "wan"
  purpose = "wan"

  wan_networkgroup = "WAN"
  wan_type         = "pppoe"
  wan_ip           = "192.168.1.1"
  wan_egress_qos   = 1
  wan_username     = "username"
  x_wan_password   = "password"
}
```
