# unifi_firewall_ruleset (Resource)

`unifi_firewall_ruleset` manages the order of individual firewall rules in a ruleset. You must provide all rule IDs present in the set for this to succeed. There can only be one ruleset resource per site and ruleset combination. Since this resource will be managed on-the-fly, importing it is optional.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "tgt_ip_address" {
  type = string
}

variable "src_ip_address" {
  type = string
}

resource "unifi_firewall_rule" "allow_from" {
  name    = "allow from single host"
  action  = "accept"
  ruleset = "LAN_IN"

  protocol = "all"

  src_address = var.src_ip_address
  dst_address = var.tgt_ip_address
}

resource "unifi_firewall_rule" "drop_all" {
  name    = "drop all"
  action  = "drop"
  ruleset = "LAN_IN"

  protocol = "all"

  dst_address = var.tgt_ip_address
}

resource "unifi_firewall_ruleset" "lan_in" {
  ruleset = "LAN_IN"
  before_predefined = [
    unifi_firewall_rule.allow_from.id,
    unifi_firewall_rule.drop_all.id,
  ]
}
```
